**Superstore Sales Dashboard Analysis**

**Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing the sales data of a Superstore. I created an interactive dashboard in PowerBI, which provides insights into the sales and profitability of the retail store over several years. In part two I took the analysis a step further and created predictive models to better understand the factors influencing sales and to predict future sales and demand for the retail store.

**Dataset:** The dataset used for this analysis is the Superstore Dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about sales, profit, and various other attributes related to the operations of the retail superstore.

**Dashboard Summary:**
Provides an overview of the following key performance metrics:

Total Sales Revenue: $2.3M
Gross Profit Margin: $286K
Revenue Growth Rate: 15.67%
Profit Growth Rate: 23.78%
Most Profitable Category: Technology

**Key Visuals**

** Sales by Region: Displays sales figures broken down by different regions (West, East, Central, South).
** Profit by Category: Highlights profit figures across various product categories (Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture).
** Profit by Customer Type: Pie chart showing profit distribution among different customer types (Home Office, Corporate, Consumer).
** Top 5 Best Selling Products: Bar chart listing the top 5 products with the highest sales.
** Top 5 Most Profitable Products: Bar chart listing the top 5 products with the highest profit.
** Sales by Customer Type: Doughnut chart depicting sales figures by customer type.
** Total Sales Overtime: Line chart showing the trend of sales over the years from 2014 to 2017.
** Worst States: Bar chart highlighting the states with the lowest profitability.
** Best States: Bar chart highlighting the states with the highest profitability.

**Insights:**

**Regional Performance:**   The West region has the highest sales, followed by the East and Central regions. The South region has the lowest sales.
**Category Profitability:** Technology is the most profitable category, followed by Office Supplies. Furniture lags significantly behind in terms of profitability. Furniture category had the second highest revenue out of all the categories, however it was by far the least profitable.
**Customer Type Analysis:**  Consumer customers (customers buying for personal use) contribute the most to profit, followed by Corporate and Home Office customers.
Product Performance: Phones are the best-selling product, and Copiers are the most profitable product.
**Geographical Insights:** California and New York are the top-performing states in terms of profit, while Texas and Ohio are among the worst-performing states. Texas produced the second most revenue, but it was the least profitable and resulted in a loss.

**Conclusion**

The regression analysis helped me better understand what affects Superstore sales. The transformed model worked the best, fixing initial data problems and fitting the data well. This detailed analysis, along with the insights from Power BI, provides a strong basis for making strategic decisions to boost sales and identify growth opportunities for the Superstore. Using both visual analytics and statistical modeling shows the benefit of using different methods to get deeper insights and make decisions based on data.
